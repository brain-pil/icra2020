## Description
More than thirty years after Moravec described one of the fundamental paradoxes of intelligence, robots still perform poorly in unconstrained or unknown environments. They have limited perception, control, and reasoning capabilities, and are not yet able to carry out natural interactions with humans. Is low level perception and mobility still the challenge?

Brain-inspired robotics, an interdisciplinary area that brings together researchers from  fields, such as robotics, cognitive science, neuroscientist, mechatronics, offers a unique promise to develop novel AI algorithms and advances the state-of-the-art in robotic perception, learning, and control. The symbiosis between these communities has already a significant place in the AI history; for example Temporal Reinforcement Learning, borrowed from operant conditioning, was the seed for the most advanced Deep-RL algorithms, which outperform humans in most challenging games invented to this date. 500 million years of brain evolution is thus a recipe book for developing engineering solutions in robotics for perception, interaction, and learning. There is only one obstacle; It is written in an unknown language. 

This workshop aims to bring forward current challenges in robotics and autonomous systems that can be solved using brain-inspired approaches and to share useful findings from neuroscience that can revolutionize AI and Robotics.

##  Call for contributions 

We cordially invite you to submit your contribution to the workshop "New advances in brain-inspired perception, interaction and learning", a full-day workshop at IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA 2020), to be held in Paris, France, on May 31st, 2020.

Send your contribution (max 4 pages) through easychair before March 15 to:

~~[https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=brainpil2020](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=brainpil2020)~~



## Call for contributions (detailed) 
We invite participants to submit extended abstracts, short papers (max 4 pages) or 5 minutes videos of relevant work. Publications to be presented at the main conference are also welcome. The accepted contributions will be posted on the workshop website but they will not appear in the official IEEE proceedings. The reviewing is single blind and will be edited by the workshop organizers.

Submissions must be sent in pdf, following the IEEE conference style (two-columns) by the easychair system: 
Any questions please send an email to brainpil@gmail.com

The template for the contributions is IEEE RAS workshop ([Latex Template](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BwUuOTzRaam6S2UtbFN4cjRFdVE)). The following paper categories are welcome:

- Short papers (max 4 pages).

- Video contribution. Submit a pdf explaining the video and embed the link on the text.

Accepted contributions will have the opportunity to present their work/ideas to the audience in a poster highlights slot. 

Moreover, excellent submissions will give a 15 min talk at the workshop.

Furthermore, a selective number of papers from the poster sessions will be invited to submit their extended novel work to Nature Machine Intelligence.
