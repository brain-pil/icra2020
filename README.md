## Description
More than thirty years after Moravec described one of the fundamental paradoxes of intelligence, robots still perform poorly in unconstrained or unknown environments. They have limited perception, control, and reasoning capabilities, and are not yet able to carry out natural interactions with humans. Is low level perception and mobility still the challenge?

Brain-inspired robotics, an interdisciplinary area that brings together researchers from  fields, such as robotics, cognitive science, neuroscientist, mechatronics, offers a unique promise to develop novel AI algorithms and advances the state-of-the-art in robotic perception, learning, and control. The symbiosis between these communities has already a significant place in the AI history; for example Temporal Reinforcement Learning, borrowed from operant conditioning, was the seed for the most advanced Deep-RL algorithms, which outperform humans in most challenging games invented to this date. 500 million years of brain evolution is thus a recipe book for developing engineering solutions in robotics for perception, interaction, and learning. There is only one obstacle; It is written in an unknown language. 

This workshop aims to bring forward current challenges in robotics and autonomous systems that can be solved using brain-inspired approaches and to share useful findings from neuroscience that can revolutionize AI and Robotics.
